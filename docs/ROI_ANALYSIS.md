## 4. ROI Calculations

### Simple ROI (5 Years)
```
Total 5-Year Benefits = $645,000 × 5 = $3,225,000
Total 5-Year Costs = $217,000 + ($179,000 × 5) = $1,112,000

ROI = ($3,225,000 - $1,112,000) / $1,112,000 × 100%
    = 190%
```

### Payback Period
```
Annual Net Benefit = $645,000 - $179,000 = $466,000

Payback = $217,000 / $466,000 = 0.47 years = 5.6 months
```

### Net Present Value (10% discount)
**NPV = $1,778,819** (highly positive)

### Internal Rate of Return
**IRR = 215%** (far exceeds 15-20% hurdle rate)
